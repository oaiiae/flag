# Go Flag Extensions

This repository contains extensions and utilities for Go's standard `flag` package.

The actual code is organized into two main subpackages:

- [flag/cli](flag/cli/README.md): A flexible command-line framework that provides command trees, subcommands, required flags, and environment variable support, fully compatible with Go's standard `flag` package.

- [flag/values](flag/values/README.md): Enhanced flag value types that extend the standard flag package with support for generics, collections, standard library types, and custom value parsing.
